FIDE World Cup 2021: CHESS
Chess is a rising sport. Yes, chess is a sport. With the air of The Queen’s Gambit, chess has got the attention it deserved. As a chess player myself, I am not quite sure if this was the attention we needed. Yes, chess has searched on Google more. Yes, more houses have chess sets now. Yes, many have hashtagged chess more. Everybody who watched mentioned their relation with chess. I personally heard many stories like “I was playing chess back in high school and I got a medal from a school tournament”. But where are those people now? Are they still following anything related to chess?


One of the biggest chess tournaments is the FIDE World Cup. I can say the FIDE World Cup is a tournament that every chess player would rank in their TOP 3. At least it is in my TOP 3 list.
The FIDE World Cup had two sections: World Cup and Women’s World Cup. They both started on 10th of July. Women’s finished on 4th of August and 4 days later the World Cup came to an end as well. The tournament took place in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia. “The venue which is close to Sochi and hosted events in the 2014 Winter Olympics is high in the mountains” (Crowther). In total there were 309 masters from nearly all around the world ( 206 players in Open and 103 players in the Women’s).  The champions were Jan-Krzysztof Duda from Poland and Alexandra Kosteniuk from Russia. 


Who is Jan-Krzysztof Duda, you might ask. Jan-Krzysztof Duda is a 23 years old Polish chess player. He had the title of grandmaster in 2013 at the age of 15 years and 21 days. “Duda won the Polish Championship in 2018 and the Chess World Cup in 2021” ("Jan-Krzysztof Duda."). As you might predict, he is a college student. I want to add that he won against Magnus Carlsen, current world champion, with a play that is  just a masterpiece. Carlsen could not show anything because Duda did not let him, which is a Carlsen thing. Here is the link for their game  → click here. Before we learn more about Alexandra Kosteniuk I want to point out that Duda had points against Carlsen. You can see the statistics for their scores. Also, the only cup Carlsen has not won is the World Cup.


Alexandra Kosteniuk has been a strong chess player for years. She is a 37 years old Russian chess grandmaster and mother. She was the Women's World Chess Champion from 2008 to 2010. “She was European women's champion in 2004 and a two time Russian Women's Chess Champion (in 2005 and 2016). Kosteniuk won the team gold medal playing for Russia at the Women's Chess Olympiads of 2010, 2012 and 2014, the Women's World Team Chess Championship of 2017, and the Women's European Team Chess Championships of 2007, 2009, 2011, 2015 and 2017” ("Alexandra Kosteniuk.").  


In the finals, Kosteniuk won against another strong Russian grandmaster Aleksandra Goryachkina. Goryachkina “is the No. 2 ranked woman in the world by FIDE rating behind only Hou Yifan. With a peak rating of 2611, she is also the fourth-highest rated woman in chess history, and the highest-ever rated Russian woman”("Aleksandra Goryachkina.") . In their game Goryachkina had the advantage and she was likely to win. Yet, she made a mistake then. Kosteniuk benefitted from the mistake Goryachkina made and turned her position. If you want to look at the game more deeply here is the link. 
As I mentioned earlier, the FIDE World Cup is one of my favorite tournaments to watch and analyze. There are many games to learn from. I would strongly recommend that you visit the official website. The link is here. I want to finish this with a clip from the tournament. Enjoy! :)
