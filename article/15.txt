How is The World Doing 
COVID-19: a virus that has been in our life since December 2019. Although the world has made a lot of progress, we still have a long way to go until we can fully get rid of this virus. One of the most important things one can do in order to both prevent and decrease the number of cases caused by this virus is to get vaccinated. We all know how our country is doing and what we should do but what are the other countries doing? How is their progress (if it exists) going? How is the rest of the world doing on covid vaccines? Let’s take a look: 


According to the Times, more than 3.76 billion people worldwide have received the COVID-19 vaccine. This is %48.9 of the world population. So the majority of the world remains unvaccinated. 


In the US and Canada 67% of the population has got at least one dose. This number is followed by Latin America with 59%, Europe by 58%, Asia-Pacific by 57%, Middle East by 39% and Africa by 7.3%. When we look at countries, U.A.E has the most people that are vaccinated; 86% of the country is fully vaccinated. This number once again is followed by Portugal (86%), Malta (85%) and Singapore (81%). Countries that have the least vaccination percentages are Congo with 0.1%, followed by; Haiti (0.2%), Chad (0.2%) and Liberia (0.2%). As you can see there are countries that are doing great and countries that are doing very poorly. About 77 percent of shots that have gone into arms worldwide have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Only 0.5 percent of doses have been administered in low-income countries.
As you can see the world has come a long way but we still certainly have a long way to go. To be able to get rid of COVID-19 soon and go back to our “normal” lives we all need to get vaccinated, social distance and wear masks. This virus has been the reason for a lot sadness for the past 2 years, and we have the power to at least slow it down and in time, stop it. Let’s use that power.
